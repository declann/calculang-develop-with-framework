# a DX pattern for calculang, using Framework 

Possibilities:

- Fork and then
- update Author details in `package.json`
- tag your repo with calculang, for discoverability
- develop something cool and share it!

Cool and license-permitting, shared things will be considered for `calculang.party`, a community gallery for calculang.

For more about calculang, see [calculang.dev](https://calculang.dev/).

## and UX patterns

UX is a separate and later goal, but will feed into `calculang.party` also, with the ability to modify and [remix](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Remix) calculations and their outputs directly.

This UX work has started with the calculang editor included in pages.
